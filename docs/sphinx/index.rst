**bsrn** is a Python package for the `Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN) <https://bsrn.awi.de/>`_.
It provides automated quality control (QC), solar geometry, clear-sky modeling, clear-sky detection (CSD),
cloud enhancement event (CEE) detection, irradiance separation, data retrieval, and visualization tools
for BSRN station-to-archive files.

The package implements a six-level QC pipeline based on the BSRN Operations Manual and Forstinger et al. (2021).
It supports multiple clear-sky models and detection methods, with seamless integration of MERRA-2 data.
